Orbit Engine Simulator! This package is intended to be easy to use by all. It uses ordinary differential equations (ODE's) to predict the orbital paths of any object with specified initial conditions. 

The GUI (frontend):
- How to use (e.g. format of initial conditions and other things that must be specified)...
- Capabilities, in the sense of what the user can do with just the GUI (e.g. can take in many units) ...
- Examples (e.g. images of output) ...

The solver (backend):
- Equations
- specific functionalities that you implemented (might have some overlap with GUI 'Capabilities' above, but here talk about the technical )
- optimizations done and things you considered (e.g. the solver normalizes with the smallest distance between objects, to prevent numerical instability) 

Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- customtkinter
